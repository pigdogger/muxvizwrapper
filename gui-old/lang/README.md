muxViz v2.0
=========

Thanks to the efforts of the community (see CREDITS.md) it has been possible to extend muxViz to some languages such as Catalan, Dutch, Italian, Japanese and [Mandarin Chinese](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKWKm5bfhEig8Ihd3psD46Noa8VNwr4ZvrhXqQQZFnk/edit?ts=58034f93#gid=818509175).

However, much more efforts are needed to complete the required files. Right now, only English is complete.

If you are interested into translating into an existing language or your own language, please use the English file as a template. The final format should exactly match the one of English CSV file.

To use your language file, rename it 'default.csv' and re-load muxViz.
