TriadsHelp,"<h5>Multilayer</h5>Calculation is performed by using the generalized definition based on walks of length 3, given in the paper below. This naturally generalizes the standard definition, where transitivity is calculated by the number of closed 3-cycles appropriately normalized. The definition is valid also for weighted networks. Note that more sophisticated definitions are available (eg, see Cozzo et al, New Journal of Physics 17, 073029 (2015))<h5>Single-layer</h5>The global clustering is calculated as the number of walks of lenght 3, appropriately normalized; valid for weighted networks. Local clustering/transitivity (at node level) is also provided for both multilayer and single-layer cases, as well as the total number of triangles for each layer, the multilayer network and the corresponding aggregation.<hr><strong>References</strong>:<ul><li> M.

DynamicsHelp,"This module allows the visualization of a dynamical process on the top of a multiplex network (although with an adequate timeline input it can also deal with time-varying networks where nodes and edges can appear or disappear). Before importing the timeline (i.e., the file where you specify the dynamics, see the Help for further details) it is mandatory to render the multiplex network at least once to obtain a complete visualization with the desired graphical options.<br>This module is designed to generate the snapshots of your dynamical process (e.g., random walks, diffusion, epidemics and/or information spreading). The snapshots are exported in the export/timeline folder.<br><br>Note that to build an animated visualization from the snapshots you need to use an external/third-party software for merging. For this task, you can use your favorite software, although we recommend <a href='https://www.ffmpeg.org/' target=\"_blank\">FFmpeg</a>. See the Help to know more details about this easy task.",help
