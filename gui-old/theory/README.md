## Fundamental models for empirical systems

Multilayer representation can be used to model a variety of empirical systems. In the following we show a few examples.

#### Visualization of multilayer networks: different approaches

#### Multiscale and multiplex model of a social system, from the molecular to the population layers

![](illustrations/life_multilayer.png "")

#### Multiplex model of a physical and virtual relationships in a social system

![](illustrations/social_mux.png "")

#### Multiscale and multiplex model of a physical transportation system

![](illustrations/transport_multimodal.png "")

#### Multiscale and multiplex model of an ecological system

## The math of multilayer networks

#### Distinct classes of multilayer models: non-interconnected vs interconnected

![](illustrations/mux_models.png "")

#### The basic ingredients of a multilayer network are: state nodes, physical nodes, layers and interactions

![](illustrations/state_nodes.png "")

#### The mathematical representation of complex objects can be understood in terms of tensors of different rank

![](illustrations/tensors.png "")

#### Operatively, rank-4 tensors can be mapped into rank-2 supra-adjacency matrices to facilitate operations (with care)

### This is achieved by means of matricization/flattening

#### Macroscopically, multilayer networks can be characterized also by the way its layers are interdependent with each other

#### In some cases, a poor representation of a multilayer network can be its aggregate
