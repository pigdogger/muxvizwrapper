### 12 June 2017

Manlio De Domenico:


Major in Analysis:

- [Milestone] Removed dependence on Octave: multilayer analysis fully written in R! 
- Removed support for multislice community detection by modularity maximization, because that code requires octave/matlab. Waiting for an R package or a standalone binary to include
- Added support for analysis of multilayer and single-layer triads (# triangles and transitivity)
- Added possibility to study the mixing of multilayer communities (ie, how communities are interconnected each other) by means of an interactive chord diagram
- Added basic multiscale analysis in community detection. By varying the relax rate in Multiplex Infomap, it is now possible to study how the number of communities and the code length change accordingly. A Sankey diagram of the results allow to visualize how communities are joined or disjoined.


Major in GUI:

- [Milestone] It is now possible to save the current state of the session, automatically saving the configuration of all panels, the results of the analysis and the plots. Added a "Session Manager" with the possibility to load/restore (or delete permanently) previously saved sessions
- Importing data simplified. With default options it's possible to import data in just 2 clicks, within the same panel
- Added "Matrix Explorer" in the import module, to allow interactive visual inspection of multilayer and aggregate adjacency matrices 
- Added possibility to color and size inter- and intra-layer edges from external file
- Motifs moved to Diagnostics framework
- Help no more present as a side panel. Instead, a small link is shown in the top-right corner
- Design improved and larger workspace

Other:

- Fixed many minor bugs
- Fixed call to binaries in Windows (thanks to Kim Klark)
- Fixed weighting edges in viz of non-edge-colored networks (thanks to Patricia GonÃ§alves)
- Added support for multiple languages (several languages in progress, but only English completed)
- Removed dendrogram image in Reducibility. When an interactive version can be developed, it will be used



### 4 December 2015

Manlio De Domenico:

- The output of reducibility analysis is now an interactive heatmap, instead of static image
- The output of ALL correlation analyses is now an interactive heatmap, instead of static image
- Added basic analysis of single-layer components per layer in Diagnostics / Statistics
- Added multilayer connected components diagnostics with interactive map for deeper inspection
- Added interactive bar chart for distribution of nodes per multilayer community in each layer
- Added possibility to analyze multilayer and single-layer communities within the same session (as for versatility analysis)
- Added interactive bar chart for distribution of nodes per multilayer component in each layer
- Added possibility to analyze multilayer and single-layer components within the same session (as for versatility analysis)
- Added possibility to color nodes by component calculated in single-layer or multilayer analysis
- Added possibility to color nodes by community calculated in single-layer or multilayer analysis
- Added possibility to query the multilayer network at node level (returns ego-networks per layer) and edge level
- Added possibility to color nodes according to query results
- Added a correlation analysis based on the Frobenius distance between layers. The matrices used for the calculation encode the shortest-path distance between all pairs of nodes (calculated in each layer separately).
- [Apparently] solved file recognition issue for Windows platforms
- Added a Console for advanced debugging. It can be found from menu File > Console
In the next future a dedicated language will be developed to allow interaction with muxViz without requiring 
any knowledge about its source code


### 19 November 2015

Manlio De Domenico:

- Added support for community detection with Multiplex Infomap
- Added new correlation analysis: node overlapping (complementary to existing edge overlapping)
- Added new Statistics panel in Diagnostics, for basic statistics about nodes and edges:
        - Nodes per layer
        - Edges per layer
        - Link density per layer
        - Diameter per layer
        - Mean path length per layer

- Solved a bug in external node coloring/sizing (thanks Licheng!)


### 8 November 2015

Manlio De Domenico:

Major in Visualization:

- Added the possibility to set custom color and size for nodes from external file (without needing to pass through the timeline, that was a bit weird temporary solution)
- Added two new templates for aggregated information to be used for calculating nodes' layout. For instance, beside full aggregation, one could opt for edges union (unweighted version of aggregation) or edges intersection (a kind of overlap). 
- Added possibility to size and color nodes according to multilayer or single-layer centrality, without restarting the session

Major in GUI:

- Added possibility to toggle boxes, it might be useful when some are not used
